# Sentiment_Analysis_Project

The Dataset of this project is very big so i can't upload these dataset on my github repository.

Developed a sentiment analysis model for IMDb movie reviews using techniques such as text preprocessing, Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and Word Embeddings. Implemented machine learning models like Naive Bayes and Random Forest to classify reviews as positive or negative, achieving high accuracy rates. Demonstrated expertise in handling text data, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

Then,I have used some step to completed my project :-


  1.IMPORT PYTHON LIBRARIES
  
  2.LOAD DATASET
  
  3.TRAINING DATASET AND DATA CLEANING
  
  4.TRAINING THE MODEL
  
  5.EVALUATING THE MODEL
